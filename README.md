## Installation
Git clone this repo to your local machine.

## Usage
To get started change the .env file to your user name and password. Then make sure you have installed all the dependencies by running `npm i` in VSCode's integrated terminal. After that run MYSQL using `mysql -u root -p` then enter your password. Once you have MYSQL running and have done a DROP DATABASE & a CREATE DATABASE, enter `source db/schema.sql` and if you want to ensure you have the ecommerce_db in your databases run SHOW DATABASES. Then run `quit` and MYSQL should exit. Run node seeds/index.js in the terminal to seed the database. If there are no errors then run an npm start from the terminal. You should get a response of "App listening on port ____" <br>  
You can see these steps executed in the below demo video:<br>
